This is an extremely basic python script to open multiple programs with just 2 easy clicks!

*MUST READ*

To setup this program you must find the location paths of the programs 
you want and replace the 3 I have already setup to my PC

If you wish to add more programs to open simply add:

	> subprocess.Popen(r"<insert file location here>")
	note: the < and > are not needed; for an example see my 3 program locations
